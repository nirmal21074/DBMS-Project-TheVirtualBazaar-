üõçÔ∏èü§ë The Virtual Bazaar üõçÔ∏èü§ë

Project Scope:-

As the name suggests, it's a Virtual Bazaar, an online retail marketplace (like Amazon, Flipkart etc.) where a user can buy a product from a wide range of products, and the retailers can sell their products. Also, there will be a  delivery person responsible for getting those products to the customer's doorstep. 
And for the customer, all these facilities are available with just a click for any product and all that being home. The platform will have various genres of products with a lot of variety, like clothes, books, electronic gadgets, furniture, etc. A person can sign up as a user to buy the product, as a retailer, or as a delivery guy who can deliver the product to the customer's doorstep. Customers can browse different products from different categories, view and update their cart, choose any favorable mode of payment, and even update their delivery address. Furthermore, retailers can add, update (make changes to the details/particulars of their products at any time they want), and delete any listed products anytime they want. Also, the delivery person can choose to accept or reject any delivery request according to them.
Our database management system will help find details and other information about retailers, delivery persons, and customers systematically by maintaining and following all the required ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties.
